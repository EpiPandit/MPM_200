# GitHub Workflow and Hummingbird Data Analysis

## Part 1: Setting Up Your GitHub Account

### Step 1: Create a GitHub Account

If you don’t already have a GitHub account, go to and create one.

What is GitHub? GitHub is a platform where developers and data scientists store, share, and collaborate on code and projects.

### Step 2: Follow the Instructor’s Repository and Account

Why? Following ensures you're connected to your instructor’s resources and updates.

After creating your account, perform these actions:

Follow this Repository: [EpiPandit/MPM_200](https://github.com/EpiPandit/MPM_200.git)

Follow your Instructor’s Accounts:

-   [PanditPranav](https://github.com/PanditPranav),

-   [EpiPandit - Github Org](https://github.com/EpiPandit),

-   [vetpsk](https://github.com/vetpsk)

## Part 2: Creating and Setting Up Your Repository

### Step 3: Use a Template to Create Your Own Repository

Navigate to this template repository: [EpiPandit/EpiPandit_Template](https://github.com/EpiPandit/EpiPandit_Template.git)

Click on the green "Use this template" button and name your repository as: `MPM_200_<YourLastName>`.

Example: If your last name is Sharma, name your repository *MPM_200_Sharma*.

Make sure your repository is 'Public'.

### Step 4: Invite Your Instructor:

Go to Settings \> Collaborators and teams in your repository.

Add both [PanditPranav](https://github.com/PanditPranav) and [vetpsk](https://github.com/vetpsk) as your collaborators.

## Part 3: Understanding GitHub Operations

-   Commit: Saves changes to your local repository or Google Colab.

-   Push: Uploads committed changes from your local repository to the remote repository on GitHub.

-   Pull: Downloads updates from the remote repository to your local repository.

## Part 4: First Commit and Repository Setup

### Step 5: Edit and Commit Your `README.md` File

What is `README.md`? It’s a markdown file that provides a summary of your project.

Open the `README.md` file in your repository.

Write a 5-sentence summary about your first assignment on hummingbird data:

-   What does your code do?

-   What are the main features and functionalities?

-   What outputs does the code generate?

After editing, commit your changes:

-   Use a meaningful commit message, for example `Initial commit` with a project summary.

-   Standard practice dictates that your message should be meaningful for all collaborators but still short and precise.

### Step 6: Organize Repository Structure

Folders in the Repository:

-   `/Data`: Upload your data files (e.g., .csv or .xlsx).

-   `/Code`: Place your analysis scripts here (e.g., .R or .ipynb files generated from Google Colab).

-   `/Outputs`: Store any results or plots generated by your code.

Upload the files and commit your changes. Use a descriptive message like: `Uploaded data, code, and output files.`

## Part 5: Updating and Analyzing Code

`Open in Colab` your code for [`Assignment4.ipynb`](https://github.com/EpiPandit/MPM_200/blob/1285826c5e02805e82344603e7420579e4741448/Session%205/Assignment%204.ipynb).

### Step 7: Modify Code for Visualization

Task: Update your code to create a timeline plot of monthly hummingbird admissions.

Differentiate between species groups using the *Species group* column.

Your plot should show admissions for two distinct species groups over time.

### Step 8: Pushing Your Changes to GitHub using Colab

After completing the code changes:

-   Commit and save your updated code directly on Github by clicking on File \> Save a Copy in Github

-   Select your newly created `MPM_200_Sharma` repository

-   Select `main` branch

-   Edit the file path to appropriate folder:

    -   `/Code/name_of_your_file.ipynb`

-   Commit message, example `Added timeline plot of monthly admissions.`

-   Refresh your repository on Github and review changes

## Part 6: Syncing Updates from the Instructor

Once you are done with the previous step, reach out to the instructor for updates on the code for this assignment.

### Step 9: Pull Changes from Your Instructor

Your instructor will push new code for Backward Selection Analysis to your repository.

-   Go to your code notebook, ensure that a new commit message has appeared

Why Check? This ensures your local version stays synchronized with the instructor's updates.

-   Open the code notebook, locate the new updates from the instructor by clicking on the `Open in Colab` button

-   Fix the code and run it to answer the questions in this assignment

## Part 7: Exploring and Interpreting the GLM Model

### Step 10: Explore Model Properties

Use this command to view the properties of the fitted model:

``` r

names(backward_model)
```

-   Q1: How many model properties are available?

### Step 11: Calculate Odds Ratios

Calculate odds ratios manually or use this command for a summary:

``` r

library(sjPlot)

tab_model(backward_model)
```

Answer these questions:

-   Q2: Which variable has the highest odds ratio for survival?

-   Q3: Do the calculated odds ratios match the values provided by sjPlot?

## Part 8: Final Push

### Step 11: Committing the new updated outputs

For submission of this assignment push the final code to your repository using instructions in [Step 8](#Step-8:-Pushing-Your-Changes-to-GitHub-using-Colab)

As usual, provide a meaningful commit message.
